# Espresso Sequencer

The Espresso Sequencer offers rollups credible neutrality and enhanced interoperability, without compromising on scale.
Consisting of a data availability solution and a decentralized network of nodes that sequences transactions, layer-2
rollups can leverage the Espresso Sequencer to give developers and end users fast confirmations, low (and fair) fees,
and robust infrastructure.

# Running the demo

Refer to [example-l2/README.md](example-l2/README.md) for instructions on how to run a dockerized Espresso Sequencer
network with an example Layer 2 rollup application.

# Development

- Obtain code: `git clone git@github.com:EspressoSystems/espresso-sequencer`.
- Make sure [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) is installed.
- Activate the environment with `nix-shell`, or `nix develop`, or `direnv allow` if using [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

## Run the tests

    just pull # to pull docker images
    cargo test --all-features

## Building figures

    make doc

## Building and running

Docker images and the [docker-compose-demo.yaml](docker-compose-demo.yaml) file are provided for convenience. The
Docker-based demo fetches the images from the `ghcr` repository, where they are updated with every push to `main` on
GitHub. For testing uncommitted changes, you can also run the binaries by manually building and running the services.

Build all executables with `cargo build --release`. You may then start a single CDN server and connect as many sequencer
nodes as you'd like. To start the CDN, choose a port `$PORT` to run it on and decide how many sequencer nodes `$N` you
will use, then run `target/release/cdn-server -p $PORT -n $N`.

The sequencer will distribute a HotShot configuration to all the nodes which connect to it, which specifies consensus
parameters like view timers. There is a default config, but you can override any parameters you want by passing
additional options to the `cdn-server` executable. Run `target/release/cdn-server --help` to see a list of available
options.

Once you have started the CDN server, you must connect `$N` sequencer nodes to it, after which the network will start up
automatically. To start one node, run `target/release/sequencer --cdn-url tcp://localhost:$PORT`. A useful Bash snippet
for running `$N` nodes simultaneously in the background of your shell is:

```bash
for i in `seq $N`; do
    target/release/sequencer --cdn-url tcp://localhost:$PORT &
done
```

Note: if the sequencer shows a `"Connection refused"` error you may need to use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` when
connecting to the CDN. This is because `localhost` may resolve to `::1` if dual stack (ipv4 and ipv6) networking is
enabled.

### Developing contracts

A foundry project for the contracts specific to HotShot can be found in the directory `contracts`.

To compile

```shell
forge build
```

To run the tests

```shell
forge test
```

In order to avoid constant warnings about checksum mismatches with [svm-rs](https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs)
managed `solc` we set `FOUNDRY_SRC` to solc installed via flake.nix.

- To use the contracts from rust generate the rust contracts bindings: `just update-contract-bindings`.

To generate documentation in `./docs` for solidity code run

```shell
forge doc
```

## Misc

### Authenticate with GitHub container registry

This is only necessary to fetch private images.

- Go to your github profile
- Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Personal access tokens (classic)
- Generate a new token
  - for the scope options of the token, tick the _repo_ box.
- Run `docker login ghcr.io --username <you_github_id> --password <your_personal_access_token>`
